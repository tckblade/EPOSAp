GUINNESS Draught is best served at 6C 
with the legendary two-part pour. 
First, tilt the glass to 45 degrees 
and carefully pour until three quarters 
full. Then place the glass on the 
bar counter and leave to settle. 
Once the surge has settled, 
fill the glass to the brim. 
It takes about 119.5 seconds to 
pour the perfect pint. 
But do not fret. It is worth the wait
